> Understand iSend's rate limiting policy and how to optimize or increase your limits.

iSend applies standard HTTP rate limiting headers in every response, following the [IETF rate-limit specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers).

| Header name           | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum number of requests allowed within the current window.       |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | Number of requests remaining before hitting the limit.              |
| `ratelimit-reset`     | Seconds remaining until the limit resets.                           |
| `retry-after`         | Seconds to wait before retrying once the rate limit has been hit.   |

## Default Limit

The default rate limit is **2 requests per second** for all API clients.

Exceeding this threshold results in a `429 Too Many Requests` response. You can monitor this via the headers above or programmatically handle it in your client.

## Best Practices

- **Queue requests**: Use background workers or task queues to regulate outbound requests.
- **Retry with delay**: Respect the `retry-after` header before re-attempting failed calls.
- **Avoid burst traffic**: Spread requests over time instead of sending large bursts.
