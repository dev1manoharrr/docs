> Learn how to authenticate, structure requests, and understand standard responses from the iSend API.

## Base URL

The iSend API follows **RESTful** principles and requires all traffic over **HTTPS**. Requests over HTTP are not supported and will be rejected.

All API requests should be made to:

https://www.isend.ai


## Authentication

To authenticate, include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the **Bearer** scheme. You can generate or manage your API keys from your [iSend Dashboard](https://www.isend.ai/dashboard).


Make sure to **keep your API key secret**. Treat it like a password.

## Response Codes

The iSend API uses standard HTTP response codes to communicate success or failure:

| Status | Description                              |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| `200`  | Email sent successfully.                 |
| `400`  | Bad request. Missing or invalid data.    |
| `401`  | Unauthorized. Invalid or missing API key.|
| `403`  | Forbidden. You do not have access.       |
| `404`  | Endpoint or resource not found.          |
| `429`  | Too many requests. Rate limit exceeded.  |
| `5xx`  | Server error on iSendâ€™s side.            |

<Info>
  Refer to [Error Codes](/api-reference/errors) for detailed information on possible response errors and troubleshooting steps.

## Rate Limiting

By default, you are limited to **2 requests per second**. If you require a higher rate limit, please contact the iSend team.

Requests exceeding the rate limit will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
